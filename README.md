# To-Do-Management-Application
This is a simple, To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. 
 
 It uses the browser's **Local Storage** feature to ensure all tasks are saved persistently.

## Features
The application provides full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality:

* **Create (Add Task):** Quickly add new items to the list via the input form.

* **Read (List Tasks):** All active and completed tasks are displayed in a list format.

* **Update (Complete/Undo):** Mark a task as complete with a single click (it uses a strikethrough effect) or undo the completion status.

* **Delete (Remove Task):** Permanently remove a task from the list.

* **Persistence:** All changes are automatically saved to your browser's Local Storage, ensuring data is not lost between sessions.
